### SURPRISE QUIZ
<br>
1. In first question, the code generates four random points which will satisfy the criteria that distance between any two points is between 5 and 6 A. The output will be the x, y, z co-ordinates of the points generated.
    
<br>    

* The first figure (1.1.png) is a 3D graph representing coordinates of points generated by the code.

<br>
2. In second question, the code calculates the Lennard-Jones potential between two points. It will take in input the co-ordinates of two particles and output the potential energy between them.

<br>
3. In third question, the code calculates the minimum potential energy using steep deviation method and generates a graph between potential energy and number of steps. It will take sigma and si as input.

<br>

* In the first, second and the third figure (3.1.png and 3.3.png), we can clearly see that the potential energy goes to a local minimum and then it stays there.

<br>
4. In the fourth question, the code will calculate hessian matrix and diagonalise it. Also, it will output the eigen vectors.
